                Concentrated Liquidity AMM is a type of Automated Market Maker (AMM) that allows liquidity providers to concentrate their liquidity in specific price ranges, rather than providing liquidity across the entire price curve. This can lead to more efficient use of capital and potentially higher returns for liquidity providers.
