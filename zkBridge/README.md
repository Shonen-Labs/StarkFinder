# zkBridge: A Trustless Cross-Chain Bridge for Starknet

## Overview
zkBridge enables secure, trustless transfers between Ethereum and Starknet using zero-knowledge proofs. By eliminating trusted intermediaries, zkBridge provides cryptographic guarantees for cross-chain asset transfers.

## Problem
Existing blockchain bridges rely on trusted validators or multi-signature schemes to verify cross-chain transactions. This introduces security vulnerabilities, as evidenced by numerous bridge hacks resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars lost.

## Solution
zkBridge implements a trustless bridge using zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically verify transactions from Ethereum on Starknet. This eliminates the need for trusted intermediaries while maintaining secure cross-chain communication.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Light Client**: An Ethereum block header verifier implemented in Cairo
- **ZK Verification**: Uses Cairo's herodotus integrity STARK verifier
- **Security Measures**: Handles reorgs and includes proof challenge mechanisms
- **Queue Management**: Implements deposit/withdrawal queues with time locks
